  overview: [
    "While VR is all about taking people into virtual worlds, AR is about bringing virtual elements into your real world. Imagine learning about dinosaurs by having life-sized ones walk in front of you. See how a particular dress fits you just by having it be augmented onto your body using your phone's camera. Want a virtual pet to roam around in your house? AR can make that possible.",
    "We’ve been teaching VR for over 12 months but this AR course is BRAND NEW! You’ll learn to design and code Augmented Reality apps using Camp K12's very own HatchXR platform."
