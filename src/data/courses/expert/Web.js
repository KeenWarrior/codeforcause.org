  overview: 'While VR is all about taking people into virtual worlds, AR is about bringing virtual elements into your real world. Imagine learning about dinosaurs by having life-sized ones walk in front of you. See how a particular dress fits you just by having it be augmented onto your body using your phone\'s camera. Want a virtual pet to roam around in your house? AR can make that possible.',
